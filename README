Scrapybara

A Capybara-based web scraping tool.  https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara

Capybara is a wonderful Ruby project created by Jonas Nicklas that offers a single DSL for automating 
interactions with web applications for integration tests. By providing a single DSL for a variety of web
drivers, Capybara allows for all sorts of awesomeness. Although it humbly thinks it is just a humble
integration testing framework, Capybara really provides a lingua franca that allows for driver independent
web tools.  Capybara lets a single scripting DSL drive a variety of drivers, including real browsers
(firefox, ie, chrome) via selenium/webdriver, direct http-level interaction via mechanize/rack, and 
simulated headless browsers (with javascript) via Akephalos and HTTP Unit, which makes Capybara make a 
flexible platform for building all sorts of web tools.

But enough about Capybara...  About me:  I provide a wrapper DSL for scraping web pages via Capybara scripts,
a system for extracting related data.

Scrapybara provides:

	- Page content extraction DSL
	- Pluggable Parameterization system (usernames, passwords)
	- Pluggable Data Outputters  
	- Error Recovery DSL for capybara navigations
  
s = Scraper.new(:outputter => MyOutputter.new, 
                :result_outputter => MyResultOutputter.new)
                                

@results = s.run(:script => File.read(txt), :parameters => CSVParams.new('filename.csv')) 

  listings = scrape(:xpath) '//tr[class=listing]' do
    address '//td[class=address]'      
    price '//td[class=address]'          
  end
    
  listings.each do |listing|
    p listing.address
    p listing.price
  end
  




To Do:
	
	- Pluggable Response Info Outputters (for easy debugging)
	- Pacing Options
