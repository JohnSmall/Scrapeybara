Scrapybara

A Capybara-based web scraping tool.  https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara

Capybara is a wonderful Ruby project created by Jonas Nicklas that offers a single DSL for automating 
interactions with web applications for integration tests. By providing a single DSL for a variety of web
drivers, Capybara allows for all sorts of awesomeness. Although it humbly thinks it is just a humble
integration testing framework, Capybara really provides a lingua franca that allows for driver independent
web tools.  Capybara lets a single scripting DSL drive a variety of drivers, including real browsers
(firefox, ie, chrome) via selenium/webdriver, direct http-level interaction via mechanize/rack, and 
simulated headless browsers (with javascript) via Akephalos and HTTP Unit, which makes Capybara make a 
flexible platform for building all sorts of web tools.

But enough about Capybara...  About me:  I provide a wrapper DSL for scraping web pages via Capybara scripts,
a system for extracting related data.

Scrapybara provides:

	- Page content extraction DSL
	- Pluggable Parameterization system (usernames, passwords)
	- Pluggable Data Outputters  
	- Error Recovery DSL for capybara navigations
